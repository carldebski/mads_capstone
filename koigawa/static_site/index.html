        <p><b style="font-size: 18px">Project Description</b> <br>For our capstone project, we are aiming to develop a tool, in a form of 
          static website, hosted entirely on AWS cloud that performs forecasting based on user input on Google Trends data. 
        Our intended users are small retail business owners who can use this tool to understand how customer demands may 
      increase or decrease in the future, which would allow the owner to, for example, get additional inventory. </p>
    
      <p>
        <b style="font-size: 18px">Instructions</b><br>Enter a single, key based on interest (e.g., cake). Once entered, the value will be sent to 
      AWS cloud hosted by Vocareum, processed by NLP and forecasting ML models to return related terms that can be used for follow-up forecasts as well as
      an Altair visualization to show forecast figures. There can be some delay after input is entered due to preflight checks and ML processing. We have three recommendations in 
      order to ensure optimal experience.

      <p>1. In order to understand what is happening, we recommend you <u><b>use developer tools</b></u>
        in Chrome by going to options > "More Tools" > "Developer Tools", in the Network section. 
        What happens once you sent an input is that OPTION call is sent first to establish CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing). Once that is done, POST method is made and various AWS services 
        together to produce output, which will be returned below. Please note that if you are running for the first time, the OPTION call might not return 200. 
        If that happens, please re-send the input. We suspect this is happening due to initial start up time.

        <p><br> 2. Because browsers such as Chrome may cache results, which won't allow the content of the site
          to be refreshed, please <u><b>use Incognito mode</b></u>, if available. <br><br>3. When entering a search term, please make sure
        that <u><b>the term is as specific as possible</b></u> (i.e., term "mocha" is preferred to "coffee").<br><br><span style="color: red"><b>NOTE</b></span>: Because GTAB library (used for forecasting)
        relies on PyTrend (unoffical API for Google Trends), sometimes <a href="https://github.com/epfl-dlab/GoogleTrendsAnchorBank/?tab=readme-ov-file#q-im-getting-the-too-many-429-error-responses-error" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">network connection issues</a> occur. During our project this issue seem to persist for a minutes at least
        and several days at most. If forecasting status fails, please try a few times and, if it still does not work, please try again later.<br></p>
